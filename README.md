# Router
A simple router for PHP, inspired by Express and Laravel.

## Description
This is a simple router for PHP, inspired by Express and Laravel. It allows you to define routes and their handlers, and then run the router to match the current request and execute the corresponding handler.

## Installation
```bash
composer require josegarcia/router
```

## Usage

```php
<?php

require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Garcia\Router;

// Example of a simple route
Router::addRoute('GET', '/health', fn () => 'Hello, world!');

// Example of a route with a parameter
Router::addRoute('GET', '/health/:id', fn ($params) => "User ID: {$params['id']}");

// Example of a route that returns a JSON response
Router::get( '/api/health/:id', fn ($params) => ['id' => $params['id'], 'name' => 'John Doe', 'email' => 'john@example.com']);

// Example of rendering a view
Router::get('/view', fn () => [
    // we need to pass the view name and the data to be rendered as a template
    'view' => 'template',
    // we can also pass the path to the views directory
    'path' => 'views',
    // we can also pass the data to be rendered
    'data' => [
        'name' => 'John Doe'
    ]
]);

Router::post('/health', fn ($params) => "Hello, {$params['name']} {$params['last']}!");

// Example of rendering
Router::get('/redirect', fn () => redirect('http://www.example.com'));

// Example of using the resource method
class Test {
    public function index(){
        return ['Hello' => 'index'];
    }
    public function store(){
        return ['Hello' => 'store'];
    }
    public function show(){
        return ['Hello' => 'show'];
    }
    public function update($params){
        return ['Hello' => "update".$params['id']];
    }
    public function destroy(){
        return ['Hello' => 'destroy'];
    }
}

Router::resource('/test', Test::class); 

Router::run();
```

## API
the router has the following methods:
get, post, put, patch, delete, options, head, any, addRoute, run, redirect, view, json, and render.

### get, post, put, patch, delete, options, head, any
These methods are used to define routes. They take two parameters: the route and the handler. The route can contain parameters, which are defined by a colon followed by the parameter name. The handler can be a function or a string. If it is a string, it is assumed to be the name of a function to be called.

### addRoute
This method is used to define routes. It takes three parameters: the method, the route, and the handler. The route can contain parameters, which are defined by a colon followed by the parameter name. The handler can be a function or a string. If it is a string, it is assumed to be the name of a function to be called.

### run
This method is used to run the router. It takes no parameters.

### redirect
This method is used to redirect to another URL. It takes one parameter: the URL to redirect to.

### view
This method is used to render a view. It takes one parameter: the name of the view to render.

### json
This method is used to return a JSON response. It takes one parameter: the data to be returned as JSON.

### render
This method is used to render a view. It takes one parameter: the name of the view to render.

### resource
This method sets multiple routes such a Get, Post, Patch, Put, Delete and sets the corresponding callbacks.
Based on restful controllers.
